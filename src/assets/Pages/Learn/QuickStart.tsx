            React apps are made out of components. A component is a piece of the UI (user interface) that has its own logic and appearance. A component can be as small as a button, or as large as an entire page.
            React components are JavaScript functions that return markup To add horizontal padding by default, specify the amount of padding youâ€™d like using the padding option in the theme.container section of your config file If you want to specify a different padding amount for each breakpoint, use an object to provide a default value and any breakpoint-specific overrides The container class also includes responsive variants like md:container by default that allow you to make something behave like a container at only a certain breakpoint and up</p>
